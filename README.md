## 🚀 Project Overview

This project automates the **detection**, **severity classification**, and **remediation recommendation** of software vulnerabilities using:

- **OpenVAS** for vulnerability scanning  
- **Random Forest ML model** for severity classification  
- **Fine-tuned T5 transformer** for AI-powered remediation generation  
- A web-based UI powered by **Flask** for easy interaction  

The system streamlines vulnerability management by providing actionable insights from scan results, helping security professionals respond faster and smarter.

## 🛠 Features

- **Automated Scanning:** Launch scans against target IPs via OpenVAS using CLI and Python integration.  
- **Data Enrichment:** Extract CVE IDs, CVSS scores, access vectors, exploit info, and more from scan data.  
- **Severity Classification:** Predicts vulnerability severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical) using Random Forest with SBERT embeddings.  
- **Remediation Generation:** Generates tailored human-readable remediation steps via a fine-tuned T5 transformer model.  
- **User-Friendly Web UI:** Easily initiate scans, view detailed reports, and get remediation suggestions from a hacker-themed interface.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model                   | Metric           | Score |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------|
| Severity Classification | Accuracy         | 98%   |
|                         | F1-Score (Macro) | 0.97  |
| Remediation Generation  | ROUGE-1          | 0.597 |
|                         | ROUGE-L          | 0.618 |

Detailed evaluation reports are available in the `model_results/` folder.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

> **Note:** The trained model files are large (~300 MB) and are not included here.  
> If you need the models, please contact me via email at **ahmadjaleel110@gmail.com**.

* Enter target IP and start an OpenVAS scan.
* Once the scan completes, view raw scan results.
* Trigger the severity classification to label vulnerabilities.
* Generate AI-powered remediation steps tailored for each vulnerability.
* Export results or use for further analysis.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Severity Classification Dataset:** Over 200,000 CVE records from NVD and ExploitDB enriched with metadata and SBERT embeddings. Stored in `checkup_database/`.
* **Remediation Dataset:** Contains remediation texts scraped and curated for 14,000+ vulnerabilities, used for fine-tuning the T5 model.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Integrate real-time NVD API for up-to-date vulnerability info.
* Upgrade SBERT embeddings with a domain-specific language model fine-tuned on MITRE CVE data.
* Develop a multi-host scanning dashboard with trend analytics.
* Improve UI/UX and extend remediation suggestions for zero-day vulnerabilities.
